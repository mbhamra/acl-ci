ACL stands for access control list. It is a way of restricting users access to features of your site depending on their
permissions. To make it easier to add permissions for users when changes are made to your site, permissions are
connected to the role rather the user. User can have multiple roles.

There is also a guest role which is activated on all users and guest user also
Where guest user action permission will be allowed to access that guest page

## Automatically fetch controller and methods name and insert it into table for you.
## You have to only the assign controller and methods permission to roles and all sets

This library uses the active record classes. So make sure _$active_record_ is set to _TRUE_ in your
/application/config/database.php file.

# Database
You are able to have your table and fields named however you like. Those modifications will need to be reflected in the
acl.php hook file. Making those changes directly to the Acl.php. 

* **acl_table**
    * Name of the database tables where users are stored

* **acl_users_fields**
    * Field names where user information is housed
        * id
             * Unique ID for user
        * role_id
             * Role ID of user

* **acl_table_permissions**
    * Name of the database tables where permissions are stored

* **acl_permissions_fields**
    * Field names where permission information is housed
        * id
            * Unique ID of permission
        * key
            * Unique string identifier of permission. This is used in your code to check for this permission

* **acl_table_role_permissions**
    * Name of the database tables where role permissions are stored

* **acl_role_permissions_fields**
    * Field names where role permission information is housed
        * id
             * Unique ID of role permission
        * role_id
             * Unique ID of role this permission belongs to
        permission_id
             * Unique ID of permission being assigned to the role

* **acl_user_session_key**
    * Name of the session key that stores the user ID

* **acl_restricted**
	* Array of controllers being restricted to role and/or user. See _Restricting By Controller_ for more details


# Restricting By Controller
Controller and method restrictions should be set in /application/config/acl.php ising the _acl_restricted_ config
value. The following is an example of how to use a basic controller/method restriction for users:

    $config['acl_restricted'] = array(
        'foo/bar' => array(
            'allow_roles' => array(2), // Comma delimated list of role IDs
            'allow_users' => array(18), // Comma delimated list of user IDs
            'error_msg' => 'You do not have permission to visit this page!'
        )
    );

Inside your controller you will need to check for the permission:

    if ( ! $this->acl->has_access())
    {
        show_error('You do not have access to this section');
    }

This will allow users in role ID 2 as well as user ID 18 to have access to the content from the _foo_ controller and
_bar_ method. Everyone else will recieve the message from _error_msg_

To restrict all methods under a controller you simply either use _foo_ or _foo/*_

To restrict all methods of a certain name under any controller you use _*/bar_

To restrict all controllers and all methods you simply use _*_ or _*/*_


# Fine Tuned Restrictions (I don't have a fancy name to call it)
If you need restrict parts of a page to users (eg. menu items, form fields, etc) then this is where you will live.

Assume you have a permission named _something_ and it is a key set up in the _permissions_ databse table. This
permission will then need to be assigned to a role. A permission being available but not assigned to a role means no
one will have access to it. The following is an example of use:

    <?php if ($this->acl->has_permission('something')) : ?>
        You has access! :)
    <?php else : ?>
        You do not have access :(
    <?php endif; ?>

If a user has permissions, they will see the message _You has access! :)_ If they do not have permission, they will see
the message _You do not have access :(_

This is the more preferred access restriction method as it gets down to the smaller details of the code.


# Name
So what's the name of this fancy thing? It's doesn't have a name. I've just been calling it ACL. If you have a fancy
name to call it, let me know what it is.


# TODO
* Automatically detect controller/method rescriptions instead of doing it through the controller. With config setting?
* Add IP based restrictions to controller/method access controlling
* Add caching to database queries
